What is Express.js?
  Express.js is a tool that helps you build
websites 
and web apps using Node.js.
It simplifies many tasks that 
you would need to do manually with Node.js.

Main Features:
Fast and Non-Blocking: Express.js is designed 
to handle tasks quickly without slowing down.
Flexible App Design: You can create different 
types of web apps, including single-page, 
multi-page, and hybrid apps.
Middleware: It helps you set up functions that handle different parts of your app, like processing requests or handling errors.
Easy Routing: Instead of using complex if-else statements to handle different web addresses (routes), Express.js makes it simple to define routes.
Dynamic HTML Rendering: It lets you create HTML pages that can change based on data.

Why Use Express.js?
Efficient: It handles multiple tasks at the same time without getting stuck.
Organized Code: It supports the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design, which helps you keep your code organized.
Simplified Routing: It makes it easy to manage different web addresses in your app.


Example Code:
const express = require('express');
const server = express(); // Create an Express app

// Define a route for the homepage
server.get('/', (request, response) => {
    response.send('Server is working fine'); // Send a response
});

// Start the server on port 1122
server.listen(1122, () => {
    console.log('Server is working'); // Log a message when the server starts
});

This example sets up a basic server that responds with "Server is working fine" when you visit the homepage and listens on port 1122.
